P5 Sketchbook
=============

My Processing sketchbook.

Contains sketches at various levels of completeness, commentedness, coolness, and correctness, ranging from "hmm" to "yea, ok".

All sketches have been tested in Processing 2.1.1

( Note: some sketches may require a [VMeter](http://vmeter.net/) )
